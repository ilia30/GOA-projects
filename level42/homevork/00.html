       <p>Perfume is one of the most successful works
        of the German writer Patrick Suskind .
        The story told in it takes place in 18th
        century France . The main character, Jean-Baptiste
        Greenouille, is gifted with a phenomenal
        sense of smell, but uses it for inhumane 
        purposes. Based on this work, 
        a film of the same name was made
        by director Tom Tykwer in 2006.</p>
